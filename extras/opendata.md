title: Open Data Sources

---

In this workshop we a small dataset published by the
[OpenFlights](http://openflights.org/) project. This data is published
under the Open Database License, one of several open data licenses
that grants rights to anyone who wants to use or redistribute the
data.

In recent years there has been a strong movement encouraging
organisations to publish data openly on the web. As a result there are
many public data repositories, both government and non-government,
that you can source data from:


* The
[Google Public Data Explorer](http://www.google.com/publicdata/directory)
indexes many public datasets and features an in-browser data explorer.
You can also download the data to perform more in-depth analysis.

* UK's Guardian Newspaper [Data Store](http://www.guardian.co.uk/data)
provides a wide range of data and data-based analysis.
([Here's a giant list of just their data sets and the articles that mention them](https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/guardian_datablog_spreadsheets/).)

* The [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/) publishes its data
catalog online.

* Numerous governments, including [Australia](http://data.gov.au/),
the [European Union](http://ec.europa.eu/atoz_en.htm) and the
[United States](http://www.data.gov/) have open dataset repositories.

* Some countries are sponsoring open data "hackathons" to raise
awareness and find new uses for their data, for instance
[GovHack](http://www.govhack.org/) in Australia.
